# LEAPS design QA

## Visual target

- Approved source: `docs/design/leaps-plate-solve-reference.png`
- Implemented capture: `docs/design/leaps-plate-solve-implementation.png`
- Side-by-side comparison: `docs/design/reference-vs-implementation.png`
- Calibration-waiver spacing comparison: `docs/design/waiver-checkbox-spacing-comparison.png`
- Target-name resolution comparison: `docs/design/target-name-resolution-comparison.png`

- Locked-sidebar implementation: `docs/design/leaps-sidebar-lock-implementation.png`
- Locked-sidebar comparison: `docs/design/leaps-sidebar-lock-comparison.png`
- Reference viewport: 1487 × 1058, including 40 px of generated-image canvas below the app window
- Implemented app viewport: 1487 × 1018
- Reference state: Photometry active; Gaia HTTP 503 failure after three bounded attempts; retry, manual target placement, and diagnostic-copy actions visible
- Production state: the current project's reduced FITS frame and target replace all illustrative WTS-2 b data; plate solving is optional and comparison stars are reviewed in the same workspace

## Review evidence

- The source and implementation were placed together in a single comparison image at equal width.
- The implementation preserves the approved three-column proportions, 265 px workflow sidebar, FITS workspace, 390 px recovery inspector, observatory palette, cyan/amber state language, target and detected-star overlays, metadata strip, and global autosave footer.
- The header and image area were adjusted after the first render to match the source proportions: 114 px page header, 68 px session footer, and approximately 706 px visible FITS image height.
- Child-frame stylesheet leakage was removed after comparison so active-navigation and target-information labels no longer gained unintended cyan or divider borders.
- The three calibration-waiver checkboxes now use a dedicated vertical layout with 10 px row spacing and 6 px top breathing room; the focused before/after capture confirms that labels and indicators no longer crowd adjacent rows.
- Target-name lookup preserves the existing coordinate-card structure, adds a compact inline status row, and fills RA/DEC in the familiar HOPS format after a successful ExoClock/SIMBAD or offline lookup.
- The locked workflow state now follows the supplied sidebar reference with a larger solid padlock, distinct muted-blue title and summary levels, and roomier icon alignment. Completed checkmarks and the active-stage ring remain unchanged so progress is still immediately recognizable.
- The production UI intentionally uses native macOS window controls rather than recreating traffic-light controls. The Observing Planner is also present under Tools as required by the product plan.
- Primary actions, sidebar navigation, manual target placement, copy diagnostics, offline-data controls, first-run settings, project setup, background processing, comparison-star approval, fitting actions, and exports are connected to application behavior.
- Pan, zoom, percentage zoom, invert, reset, and full-screen controls operate on a real FITS scene; aperture and sky-annulus overlays retain consistent line weight while the image is zoomed.
- The supplied TrES-3 project restores 21 bias, 7 dark, 5 flat, and 354 science assignments from its manifest instead of reverting to default filename classifiers.
- The TrES-3 header WCS is no longer trusted merely because it parses: its nominal coordinate landed on blank sky, so LEAPS corrected the pointing offset with 24 cached Gaia matches and snapped TrES-3 to the detected host at x 1029.5, y 932.5 (0.340 arcsec/pixel).
- Photometry uses HOPS star detection and measurement routines, preserves variable-aperture and geometric-centering controls, checkpoints every frame, and writes the expected aperture/Gaussian tables, light curves, FOV figures, and results figures.
- A real-data smoke run measured TrES-3 plus three ranked comparisons across 10 reduced frames; all 10 aperture light-curve rows were finite and the results figure was generated.

## Accessibility and responsive checks

- The main window resizes down to 1120 × 720 and restores valid saved geometry.
- Scientific controls and consequential actions use keyboard-focusable controls with descriptive tooltips.
- Circled information controls expose an accessible name and non-empty tooltip; automated UI coverage verifies at least 15 are present in the selected workspace build.
- Long recovery text wraps in a scrollable inspector, and processing never disables the entire application window.

## Verification

- `python3 -m py_compile leaps/*.py leaps/ui/*.py hops/hops_tools/*.py hops/thirdparty/twirl/*.py`
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen pytest -q`: 38 passed
- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .`: passed (the unchanged vendored `hops/` package is excluded)
- `pyside6-deploy -c pysidedeploy.spec --dry-run --force`: deployment command generated successfully
- Offscreen Qt launch and deterministic screenshot: passed
- Reference versus implementation visual review: passed
- Locked-sidebar source versus implementation review: passed; no P0, P1, or P2 visual issues found

## Fit preview file reveal

- Source visual: `/var/folders/wg/4c5ys1f50kg_hwllv6bpb4fc0000gn/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_gM0bHN/Screenshot 2026-07-13 at 13.52.25.png`
- Implementation capture: `/private/tmp/leaps-fit-preview-view-in-files-2.png`
- Side-by-side comparison: `/private/tmp/leaps-fit-preview-comparison-2.png`
- The `View in Files` action sits directly beneath the preview and follows LEAPS button, spacing, icon, and color conventions.
- Generated fit previews are 2400×1680, and in-app rendering uses device-pixel-ratio-aware smooth scaling.
- The button remains disabled until a valid preview exists and reveals the exact image in Finder or Explorer.
- Focused fitting and UI tests, Ruff, compilation, and diff checks passed.

final result: passed

## FITS Header Viewer and HOPS Filter Selection QA

- Source visual truth: `/Users/ashersuter/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-07-15 at 13.29.25.png`
- Implementation screenshot: `/tmp/leaps-filter-visual-smoke.png`
- Combined comparison: `/tmp/leaps-filter-comparison.png`
- Viewport: 800 × 800 offscreen Qt surface
- State: Data & Target open, first science FITS detected as `R`, filter menu open with no user selection

**Full-view comparison evidence**

The implementation keeps the established LEAPS Data & Target layout and theme. The new control is positioned below Target Coordinates, reports the FITS value separately, and leaves the menu at `No filter chosen`.

**Focused comparison evidence**

The combined comparison verifies the exact HOPS labels and ordering: `No filter chosen`, `Clear`, `Luminance`, `U`, `B`, `V`, `R`, `I`, `H`, `J`, `K`, `Astrodon ExoPlanet-BB`, `u'`, `g'`, `r'`, `z'`, `i'`. Focused comparison was necessary because the supplied source depicts only the expanded menu rather than a complete application window.

**Findings**

- No P0, P1, or P2 differences remain. The menu content, ordering, and null default match the supplied HOPS reference.
- The Qt popup intentionally uses LEAPS typography, density, colors, and selection treatment instead of copying HOPS window chrome. This preserves the existing desktop design system and does not alter the requested behavior.
- No image assets are present in the referenced control.

**Required fidelity surfaces**

- Fonts and typography: Existing LEAPS application typography is preserved; every menu label is readable and untruncated.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: The control follows existing LEAPS form spacing and fits within the Target Coordinates card.
- Colors and visual tokens: Existing LEAPS canvas, border, text, and cyan-selection tokens are used consistently.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: Not applicable; the source control contains no product imagery or custom assets.
- Copy and content: Menu labels, capitalization, apostrophes, and ordering match the reference.

**Comparison history**

- Initial pass: no actionable P0/P1/P2 mismatch was found, so no visual correction loop was required.

**Implementation checklist**

- Confirm the menu remains non-editable and defaults to the null entry.
- Keep FITS detection advisory only.
- Preserve the existing LEAPS theme and layout behavior.

**Follow-up polish**

- None required for the requested control.

final result: passed
